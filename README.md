1. Create a new rails application called alpha-blog Make sure you are out of your existing rails application when creating this, it's a common mistake by beginners to launch an application from within the application they're working with already.

2. Once created, set up a git and github repository for it. Make a commit of your code with the message "Initial commit".

3. Create two routes for it, one for the home page as the root route which simply says this is the Home page. And another for the About page, just like we did here in the test application.

4. Make sure you are able to start the server and see both pages form the browser. Take snapshots of both pages and post them in the Q & A of this video.

5. Once done, make another commit of your code, and push the code to your github repository and share the Github repo link in the 1 & A as well.
